# Logistic-Regression
An example implementation of logistic regression using Python and NumPy

 The code generates two sets of randomly distributed data points, assigns them labels, and trains a logistic regression model to classify them. 
 The model is trained using the gradient descent optimization algorithm and its accuracy is compared with that of a logistic regression model implemented using the 
 scikit-learn library. The code also includes visualizations of the data points and the decision boundary of the trained model.
